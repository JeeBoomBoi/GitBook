# The genesis

Date: 31/1/2021

Starting off my placement preparation from today, well I believe I have time till mid of June. Things to concentrate on:

* Verbal, Aptitude and Quants
* DSA, DBMS, OS and DBMS
* Gotta prepare for the cheesy questions
* Make more projects, maintaining a resume and make more connections

This is more like a blog where I document my code everyday day for the next 4-5 months. 

Languages: Python and C++
